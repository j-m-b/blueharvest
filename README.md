TODO: import .jar into Android Studio App!
1. .jar file in lib directory and 'adding as library' compiles; however,
execution fails with a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError.
2. adding the .jar file as a module doesn't compile.
3. switched the jdk from 1.8 to 1.7, still the app crashes.

TODO: fix repository mess!
